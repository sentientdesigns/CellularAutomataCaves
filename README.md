# CellularAutomataCaves
A simple java-based application of a cave generator based on cellular automata for the international summer school on Artificial Intelligence and Games.

You can simply open the CellularAutomataCaves.jar file in the dist folder: press 'r' to create a new random seed, and then apply 'm' for applying Cellular Automata via the Moore neighborhood, and 'n' for applying Cellular Automata via the von Neumann neighborhood.

# CellularAutomataCaves
A simple java-based application of a cave generator based on cellular automata for the international summer school on Artificial Intelligence and Games.

You can simply open the CellularAutomataCaves.jar file in the dist folder: press 'r' to create a new random seed, and then press 'm' for applying 1 step of Cellular Automata via the Moore neighborhood, or press 'n' for applying 1 step of Cellular Automata via the von Neumann neighborhood.
